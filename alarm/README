COMP 116 - Assignment 2
Margaret Feltz
README

All aspects of the assignment have been implemented correctly. My alarm.rb
correctly analyzes a live stream of network packets as well as a log for
incidents. 

The live analysis correctly identifies NULL scan, FIN scan, Xmas scans by
searching the packet flags for which ones are toggled on, and Nmap scans,
Nikto scans, and Credit card leaks by searching the packet payload
for patterns using regular expressions.
 
The log analysis correctly identifies Nmap scans, Nikto scans, Rob Graham's
Masscan, and anything pertaining to phpMyAdmin by searching for the strings
'nmap', 'nikto', 'masscan', and 'phpMyAdmin' respectivley using regular
expressions. Shellshock and shellcode incidents are found using patterns
and regular expressions.

I collaborated with Susie Church and Sam Weiss.

I spent approximately 5 hours on this assignment, reading and developing.

1. The heuristics are not very good because the checks for each type of
scan or incident are very simple. More malicious and cautiously executed
scans would probably be harder to discover.

2. I think for simplicity sake, for the logs, I would print out a frequency
table of each type of incident detected. Then require that flags be
implemented to clarify if details of each scan or provide the ability to
filter by type of incident.
