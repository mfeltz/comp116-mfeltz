Assignment 1

=================================================================

set1.pcap
1. 861 packets
2. TCP
3. TCP was created for open communication and therefore allows for
   sniffing and the ability to interupt packets and send malicious
   packets back to a computer on a receiving end. 
4. SFTP 
5. 192.168.99.130
6. defcon, m1ngisablowhard
7. 6 files
8. COaqQWnU8AAwX3K.jpg

set2.pcap
10. 77982 packets 
11. 12 pairs, 11 of which are anonymous
12. ettercap -T -r set2.pcap | grep -a "PASS" 
    dsniff -p set2.pcap

14.   One username-password pair is legitimate. larry@radsot.com
is legitamate because after login, the server responds saying 
'OK LOGIN Ok'
=================================================================

set3.pcap
15. Running 'dsniff -p set3.pcap -n' returned a lot of results with
the defcon result appearing multiple times. I found 11 unique username
and password pairs, 9 of which were generic.

17. Of the 2 non-generic username-password pairs, one is legitimate.
The username=seymore,password=butts pair hits a 403 Forbidden page
on forum.defcon.com saying that the credentials don't work on http.
The username=jeff,password=asdasdasd pair hits an Unauthorized page
that tells the user that they either don't have access to the page
or they entered the wrong credentials.

These are all hostnames associated with packet numbers. a ','
indicates hostname of source IP of the packet and a '-' indicates
hostname of destination IP. I went into settings and checked off
resolve IP addresses and it replaced the IP addresses with their
corresponding hostnames. I wasn't able to sort by unique hostnames
but if I had more time to, I would sort by unique hostnames
to compile a list of all of them and their associated IP addresses.
=================================================================

General Questions
19. To verify the successful username-password pairs, I found the
corresponding packet in Wireshark and followed the TCP stream. By
reading the messages between the server and the machine, once a
user entered their credentials, the server would respond along the
lines of 'OK LOGIN' to verify the login was successful.

20. My advice to these users is to use a secure file transfer
protocol such as SFTP to protect their sensitive information from
being sniffed.
